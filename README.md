- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ginevra-Sade, a self-taught coder on maternity leave, squeezing in Python and SQL between diaper changes and caffeine refills. Building a GitHub portfolio because, apparently, *that's a thing* now.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, SQL, and my new little squish - obvs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 🐍, SQL 🛢️ & Spansih
- 🌎 From Canada
- 🛠 Working on leveling up my coding skills and shamelessly learning from the Gen Z coding wizards.
- ⚠️ Currently on maternity leave. Please contact me at your own risk — I’m probably running on 2 hours of sleep, 1 coffee, and a whole lot of “why did I sign up for this?” energy.
